# Changelog
## 1.7.1 — 2026-06-14

Packaging + CI follow-up to v1.7.0 — completes the npm distribution channel, patches three dependency CVEs, and fixes the dependency-audit gate.

### Security
- **Dependency security floors.** Patched three known CVEs by pinning to fixed releases and re-locking. Two are **runtime** floors shipped to users: `idna>=3.15` (CVE-2026-45409, transitive via httpx) and `starlette>=1.0.1` (PYSEC-2026-161, transitive via fastapi). One is a **dev** floor: `urllib3>=2.7.0` (PYSEC-2026-141/142, transitive via pip-audit/requests). The audited tree now carries no known CVEs.

### Packaging
- **npm distribution now publishes via OIDC trusted publishing.** `@mcptoolshop/xrpl-lab` is published from this repo's new `release.yml` (on tag push) using npm provenance + OIDC — **no tokens**. The binary-launcher wrapper (`package.json` + `bin/xrpl-lab.js`) now lives in-repo beside the Python package; `npx @mcptoolshop/xrpl-lab` downloads the SHA-256-verified release binary for the matching tag.

### CI
- **`pip-audit` gate fixed.** Dropped `--strict`: it makes pip-audit exit non-zero whenever a dependency is *skipped*, including the editable self-package we skip with `--skip-editable`, so the audit failed even with zero vulnerabilities (`distribution marked as editable`). Without `--strict` the audit still fails on any *real* vulnerability. The single residual advisory against `pip` itself — the installer toolchain, not a declared dependency — is explicitly ignored; `verify.sh` updated to match.

## 1.7.0 — 2026-06-14

Testnet-Only Enforcement, Network Honesty, and a Dashboard Redesign — a re-audit dogfood swarm (Stage A security, Stage B/C proactive + behavioral health, Stage D visual polish via Claude Design), each wave audit → amend → adversarially verified.

### Security
- **Testnet-only is now enforced in code, not just by default + docs.** A new `classify_network()` (fail-closed, suffix-spoof resistant) gates all five signing methods **and** the faucet: a mainnet or unrecognized `XRPL_LAB_RPC_URL` / `XRPL_LAB_FAUCET_URL` override is refused before the wallet seed touches the network. `network_name`, `get_network_info`, and `doctor` now report the real endpoint instead of a hard-coded `"testnet"`.
- **PyPI publish action SHA-pinned** (`pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish@…` v1.14.0) — the sole un-pinned action, on the only `id-token: write` job.
- **No path leakage across the WS boundary** — the session-export `MANIFEST.json` no longer embeds the facilitator's absolute path; the runner's recovery- and completion-save guards surface only the exception type name (full detail to the server log).

### Network honesty (artifacts)
- Proof packs, certificates, reports, the feedback bundle, `/api/status`, and the dashboard no longer mislabel dry-run/devnet runs as `"testnet"`. `state.network` is stamped per-run from the active transport; per-tx explorer links resolve from each transaction's own network (`testnet.xrpl.org` / `devnet.xrpl.org` / none) — **no more dead `testnet.xrpl.org` links baked into a sealed dry-run proof pack.** The top-level pack network reads `"mixed"` when a session spanned networks.
- **`GET /api/status`** now returns `network` + `version`; **new `GET /api/health`** is an instant, network-free liveness probe (distinct from the network-bound `/api/doctor`).

### Dashboard redesign
- A full **"calm instrument panel"** visual redesign (via Claude Design): a sidebar shell, a real type system (Space Grotesk / Hanken Grotesk / JetBrains Mono, embedded offline), status encoded as shape + glyph + label + hue, an accessible ARIA tablist for Artifacts, and a **branded, focus-trapped modal that replaces the native `confirm()`/`alert()`** kill dialog.
- **`xrpl-lab serve` mounts the built dashboard in-process** (`./site/dist` or `$XRPL_LAB_DASHBOARD_DIR`) — a single command serves both the API and the dashboard; warns on a non-loopback bind.
- `serve` configures application logging (facilitator breadcrumbs now surface); a 45s WS **liveness watchdog** flags a silently-hung server; fresh-install empty-state guidance; `doctor.log` retains each check's hint.

### Reliability
- Windows atomic-write race fixed (`os.replace` bounded retry under concurrent `state.json` reads); faucet 429 backoff bounded; fire-and-forget session-cleanup tasks retained against asyncio GC.

### Tests + CI
- **702 → 785 tests** — testnet-only enforcement (incl. host-spoof + faucet-override), network honesty (no dead dry-run links), atomic retry, adversarial no-secret / no-path-leak, `/api/health`, WS back-pressure. CI adds a `pip-audit` dependency scan; the testnet smoke test gains failure observability.

## 1.6.0 — 2026-05-01

Hardening + Workshop Resilience — security tightening, structured error envelopes, AMM math correction, and four new facilitator commands. Driven by a 10-phase dogfood swarm covering Stage A bugs/security, Stage B proactive defense, Stage C humanization, Stage D visual polish, and a Feature Pass over deliberate workshop gaps.

### Security
- **WebSocket Origin enforcement** — `/api/run/{id}/ws` rejects non-allow-listed origins with close code 4003 + structured close-reason citing the allow-list. Mitigates cross-origin attack surface against the dashboard runner.
- **Wallet seed atomic write** — `actions/wallet.py` now uses `os.open(O_WRONLY|O_CREAT|O_TRUNC, 0o600)` instead of `write_text`+`chmod`. Closes the TOCTOU window where another process could read the file between create and chmod.
- **Workspace mode policy** — home directory `~/.xrpl-lab/` enforced 0o700 (private secrets); workspace `./.xrpl-lab/` left 0o755 (designed-shareable for facilitator review). Two-tier policy documented in `SECURITY.md`.
- **Structured error envelopes** — every WS error frame now emits `{code, message, hint, severity, icon_hint}` via the canonical `_error_envelope()` producer. No path leakage, no internal-state leakage. Pedagogically routed: `severity` drives dashboard styling, `icon_hint` drives glyph choice.
- **`RUNTIME_FAUCET_RATE_LIMITED` end-to-end delivery** — testnet faucet 429 responses are humanized at the transport layer, raised as `LabException(faucet_rate_limited())` from runtime `ensure_funded`, and reach the WS envelope with severity=warning + icon_hint=clock. Distinct UI treatment from generic network errors.
- **Bounded WS queue** — `_safe_put` drops oldest-then-newest under back-pressure; documented per-connection memory ceiling.

### Workshop resilience
- **State.json atomic writes** — `state.py` write-to-tmp + `os.replace` for crash-safe persistence; stale `.tmp` siblings cleaned up before write to avoid partial-write reuse.
- **WS reconnect with lifetime cap** — dashboard run page reconnects on transient disconnects with exponential backoff and a 20-attempt lifetime ceiling. Per-cycle budget resets on first successful message.
- **`doctor` depth** — pedagogical messages for `tecNO_DST` (10-XRP base reserve activation), `tecINSUF_RESERVE` (per-object reserve scaling), `tecNO_LINE` (token opt-in security model), `telINSUF_FEE_P` (testnet fee dynamics).
- **Recovery + status humanization** — `xrpl-lab status`, `xrpl-lab recovery`, `xrpl-lab tracks` rewritten for warmth and clarity. Trust-line failures explain directionality + opt-in. Already-completed messages clarify `--force` semantics.
- **Color-independence** — projector-friendly icon + color + text on every status surface (`doctor`, `list`, `status`, `tracks`). Verified under `NO_COLOR=1`.

### New facilitator features
- **`xrpl-lab cohort-status`** — aggregates per-learner status across a cohort directory. Tolerates corrupt state.json per-learner with a warning row. Table + JSON output.
- **`xrpl-lab session-export`** — archives all learner artifacts (proofs, reports, audit packs, certificates) with a SHA-256 manifest. Excludes `wallet.json`, `state.json`, `doctor.log` by design. tar.gz + zip formats.
- **`xrpl-lab reset --module MODULE_ID`** — granular per-module reset that preserves wallet, audit packs, and other modules. Closes the "stuck on one module" recovery gap.
- **`xrpl-lab module init`** — scaffolds a lint-passing module skeleton with frontmatter, step section, and TODO markers. Validates against curriculum catalog.
- **DELETE `/api/runs/{run_id}`** — facilitator can cancel a stuck learner run; emits `RUNTIME_CANCELLED` envelope, closes WS with code 1000, frees concurrency slot. Idempotent on already-cleaned runs.
- **Facilitator dashboard page** — new `/app/facilitator/runs/` lists active learner runs with kill button and cohort capacity badge. Auto-refreshes; pauses polling when tab hidden; cleans up listeners on Astro client-side nav.

### Distribution
- **Auto-publish to PyPI** — `.github/workflows/publish-pypi.yml` triggers on `release: published`, with prerelease guard (`!github.event.release.prerelease`) preserving `workflow_dispatch` manual fallback.
- **`verify.sh` uses `uv build`** — single command produces sdist + wheel; works in uv-managed venvs without pip on PATH.

### Pedagogy
- **AMM math correction** — first-LP deposit uses Uniswap V2 `sqrt(a*b)` (not arithmetic mean); subsequent deposits use binding-ratio `min(da/pa, db/pb)` with refund of the over-provided side. Zero-pool deposits return zero LP per the V2 invariant. Receipt audit module's verdict logic now matches.
- **Error message humanization with XRPL concepts** — every error path teaches the concept it surfaces (reserves are minimum balance not fee; trust lines are directional; fee dynamics scale per testnet load). Mechanical strings replaced with pedagogically-routed text.

### Documentation
- **`CONTRIBUTING.md`** — community contributor guide for module authors, including the new `xrpl-lab module init` workflow.
- **`SECURITY.md` workshop-setup section** — facilitator-facing setup guidance (per DD-4 carry-in resolution).
- **README Commands block** — 4 new v1.6.0 commands listed with accurate help text.
- **README threat model paragraph** — refreshed to reflect WS Origin enforcement, atomic writes, workspace mode policy, and the "protected by file permissions, not encrypted" correction.

### Tests
- **+162 tests across the swarm** (564 → 726). Highlights: `TestErrorEnvelopeBackwardCompat` (parametrized severity-mapping per code prefix), `TestDeleteRunEndpoint` (DELETE → WS message delivery), `TestSessionExport` (extraction round-trip + secret-leakage scan), `TestInputModuleNotFoundEmissionPath` (Pattern #3 production-emission-path closure), `TestWalletParentDirMode` (DD-1 0o700 enforcement), 14 focused tests for the new `_atomic_write_json` helper.
- **0 xfailed sustained throughout** — strict gate held across all 60+ commits.

### Refactors (Phase 10 carry-in closures)
- `_atomic_write_json` helper extracted from `wallet.py` + `state.py` (DRY).
- `_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` single source of truth in `xrpl_lab/api/runner_ws.py`; imported by `xrpl_lab/server.py`.
- Test-side `._*` AppleDouble glob skip in `tests/test_linter.py` (T9 exFAT defense).
- Session-isolation fixture applied to `TestRunWebSocket` and `TestStartRun` classes.

## 1.5.0 — 2026-04-15

Humanization Pass — clearer, steadier, more motivating copy across every learner-facing surface.

### Voice Lock (5A)
- Canonical voice definition: "clear, steady, respectful, lightly encouraging"
- Voice constant added to `workshop.py` module docstring as the single reference

### Module Openers + Closers (5B)
- Removed mechanical "Welcome to X" pattern from all 12 module openers
- Varied checkpoint closers — no more identical footer boilerplate
- Dropped repetitive "Your report and transaction IDs are saved" from all modules
- Each module now opens with what you'll learn and closes with what comes next

### Fear-Point Reassurance (5C)
- Added "nothing here is permanent" and "testnet costs nothing" at trust line, DEX, reserve, and AMM entry points
- AMM and DEX vs AMM modules note "no real assets at risk" (dry-run mode)
- Account hygiene opener: "routine maintenance, not surgery"

### Recovery + Blocker Copy (5D)
- Humanized all blocker messages in `workshop.py` — less mechanical, more reassuring
- Recovery hint situations and explanations rewritten for warmth and clarity
- "No wallet configured" → "No wallet yet"; "Module X requires" → "X builds on Y"

### Completion + Track Recaps (5E)
- Runner completion panel: cleaner title, grammar-aware transaction count
- CLI tracks and recovery panel titles simplified ("Tracks", "Recovery")

### CLI/Dashboard Copy Pass (5F)

- Doctor output: dropped "Hint:" prefix, cleaner pass/fail language
- Error hints humanized: shorter sentences, warmer tone
- `tx_failed` message simplified from "Transaction failed with result: X" to "Transaction failed: X"

- README and handbook workshop sections: "Everything runs locally"

### Tests
- 564 tests, 0 failures, ruff clean

### Tests
- 534 → 564 tests (+30 workshop tests)

## 1.3.0 — 2026-04-15

Curriculum Spine — module structure, progression, and learner navigation as first-class truth.

### Module Metadata Lock (3A)
- New required frontmatter fields: `track`, `summary`, `mode`
- Five canonical tracks: foundations, dex, reserves, audit, amm
- `mode` field (testnet/dry-run) replaces inferred `dry_run_only` boolean
- `requires` cleaned to reference only module IDs (removed `wallet` as implicit)
- All 12 modules standardized with uniform metadata shape

### Progression Truth (3B)
- `curriculum.py` — directed graph of modules with prerequisite edges
- Topological sort respecting track order and module order
- `next_module(completed)` — deterministic next valid module
- Cycle detection, orphan detection, transitive prerequisite queries
- `CurriculumGraph.validate()` — checks tracks, summaries, prereqs, modes, cycles

### Curriculum-Aware Lint (3C)
- `xrpl-lab lint` now validates curriculum structure (prereqs, cycles, tracks, modes)
- `--no-curriculum` flag to skip cross-module checks
- `lint_curriculum()` function for programmatic use
- Broken prerequisite references, missing tracks, and cycles caught at author time

### Learner Navigation Surfaces (3D)
- `list` command shows track column, curriculum-ordered modules, `▸` next-module indicator
- `start` command uses curriculum graph for next-module selection with summary/track/mode info
- API `/api/modules` returns curriculum-ordered list with `track`, `summary`, `mode`, `is_next`
- `ModuleSummary` schema updated (TS + Python in sync, drift test passing)

## 1.2.0 — 2026-07-24

Authoring Spine — registry-based dispatch, structured payloads, module linter.

### Action Registry (2A)
- Central `registry.py` with `ActionDef`, `PayloadField`, `PayloadSchema`, `register()`, `resolve()`
- All 37 actions registered with metadata (description, wallet_required, payload_fields)
- `handlers.py` — extracted all action handlers from runner.py into standalone async functions
- `runtime.py` — shared utilities (_SecretValue, ensure_wallet, ensure_funded)
- `runner.py` shrunk from ~1750 to ~330 lines: thin `_execute_action()` does registry lookup → wallet gate → validate → dispatch

### Structured Payloads (2B)
- Quote-aware parser: `_parse_action_args()` supports `key="value with spaces"` and `key='value'`
- Typed payload validation (str, int, decimal, bool, enum, list) via `PayloadSchema.validate()`
- Validation wired into dispatch — bad payloads caught before handler runs

### Module Linter (2C)
- `linter.py` — validate frontmatter, action names, payloads, dry_run_only labeling
- `xrpl-lab lint [glob] [--json]` CLI command for author-time and CI validation
- 6 test fixture modules (3 error types + dry-run labeling mismatches + good baseline)
- JSON output for CI integration

### Tests
- 478 → 502 tests (+17 registry, +12 payload, +13 linter = +42 net, minus test renumbering)

## 1.1.0 — 2026-07-23

Truth + Continuity pass — no new modules, tighter semantics.

### Camp Continuity
- `start` imports camp wallet seed for real (reads `~/.xrpl-camp/wallet.json`, validates via `Wallet.from_seed()`, saves to lab wallet path)
- Honest messaging: no "Starting with your existing wallet" unless import succeeds

### Proof Verification CLI
- `proof verify <file>` — verify proof pack integrity (SHA-256 hash check)
- `cert-verify <file>` — verify certificate integrity
- Both support `--json` for machine-readable output
- Exit code 1 on failure

### Dry-Run Semantics
- All `--dry-run` help strings updated from "Run without network" to "Offline sandbox: simulated transactions, real local persistence"
- Start banner explains sandbox behavior clearly

### Dry-Run-Only Modules
- `dry_run_only: true` frontmatter flag for AMM modules (amm_liquidity_101, dex_vs_amm_risk_literacy)
- `list` command shows Mode column (testnet / dry-run)
- `start` command shows `(dry-run only)` tag for labeled modules

### Tests
- 456 → 461 tests (+5 verify command tests)
